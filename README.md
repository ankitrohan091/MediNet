# medinet_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# Community Health App

This is my first Flutter application, a community health app focused on health-related problems. It allows users to add their health problems, share their experiences by adding posts, browse posts, browse unanswered questions on the home page, and more. 

## Features

The Community Health App has the following features:

- User registration and login- User profile page- Change password functionality- Add health problems- Browse posts with filter options- Add posts with images- Browse unanswered questions on the home page- About us page- Help section page

## Getting Started

To run this application, you will need to have Flutter installed on your system. You can download Flutter and follow the installation instructions on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Once Flutter is installed, you can clone this repository and run the app using the following commands:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/community-health-app.gitcd community-health-appflutter run


This will launch the app on your connected device or emulator.

## Next Steps

To continue learning and improving this app, you can try adding more features, such as:

- Adding comment functionality to posts- Implementing a search functionality for posts- Adding notifications for new posts and comments- Integrating a chat feature for users to communicate directly- Adding a feature to share posts on social media
